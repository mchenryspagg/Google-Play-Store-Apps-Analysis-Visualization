## About

In this project, I'd be will be working on a real-world dataset of the google play store, one of the most used applications for downloading android apps. This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset, and mining informational quality insights. This project also involves visualizing the data to better and easily understand trends and different categories.


## Project Description

This project will help one understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using python for a better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database, and visualize the data with the power bi tool. The Project will consist of 2 modules:

Module 1: Pre-processing, Analyzing data using Python and SQL.

Module 2: Visualizing data using Power BI.


## Dataset

- This **[data set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19fVBgoQJr5jkupe0O9Ht8VeMqSVaBJae/view?usp=share_link)** contains two csv  files of data scraped from google play store app for the period of 2010 - 2018.  The first dataset - `apps` contains data on play store apps and its attributes, while the other dataset - `reviews` containing data on customer reviews for each playstore app.  

- Key variables in the dataset includes :

**apps dataset**

| Current Ver | the current version of the app |
| Android Ver | the minimum android version app can run on |


**reviews dataset**

| Variables | Details |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| App | google play store app name |
| Translated Review | reviews of app per each user  |
| Sentiment | positive, negative or neutral |
| Sentiment_Polarity |  polarity score based on user reviews | 
| Sentiment_Subjectivity | subjectivity score based on user reviews |



## Research Questions

Understand the following requirements and query the dataset using MYSQL for displaying the required solution:

1. Which apps have the highest rating in the given available dataset?

2. What are the number of installs and reviews for the above apps? Return the apps with the highest reviews to the top.

3. Which app has the highest number of reviews? Also, mention the number of reviews and category of the app

4. What is the total amount of revenue generated by the google play store by hosting apps? (Whenever a user buys apps  from the google play store, the amount is considered in the revenue)

5. Which Category of google play store apps has the highest number of installs? also, find out the total number of installs for that particular category.

6. Which Genre has the most number of published apps?

7. Provide the list of all games ordered in such a way that the game that has the highest number of installs is displayed on the top (to avoid duplicate results use distinct)

8. Provide the list of apps that can work on android version 4.0.3 and UP.

9. How many apps from the given data set are free? Also, provide the number of paid apps.

10. Which is the best dating app? (Best dating app is the one having the highest number of Reviews)

11. Get the number of reviews having positive sentiment and number of reviews having negative sentiment for the app 10 best foods for you and compare them.

12. Which comments of ASUS SuperNote have sentiment polarity and sentiment subjectivity both as 1?

13. Get all the neutral sentiment reviews for the app Abs Training-Burn belly fat 

14. Extract all negative sentiment reviews for Adobe Acrobat Reader with their sentiment polarity and sentiment subjectivity
